# Eye of Odin - OSINT Digital Footprint Scanner

## Project Overview

Eye of Odin is an OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tool designed to scan and analyze public digital footprints. It helps users understand their online exposure and digital privacy by leveraging OSINT methodologies to gather information from publicly available sources and APIs.

The primary goal of Eye of Odin is to provide users with insights into the amount of data available about them or a target entity on the internet, using ethical and publicly accessible methods. It aims to be a user-friendly interface for performing common OSINT tasks related to digital footprint analysis.

This project was initially created with the assistance of Lovable.dev.

## Features

Eye of Odin incorporates several key features to facilitate digital footprint analysis:

*   **Target Scanning:** Ability to initiate scans against specified websites or online entities.
*   **API Integrations:** Leverages external APIs such as Google Custom Search for broad web searches and Have I Been Pawed (HIBP) for breach data checks.
*   **Data Gathering:** Collects information from publicly available sources, simulating OSINT methodologies.
*   **Results Visualization:** Presents scan results in a clear and user-friendly dashboard, providing actionable insights into the digital footprint.
*   **Threat Reporting (Planned/In Progress):** Aims to generate comprehensive reports summarizing the findings and potential risks.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using a modern web development stack:

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui component library
*   **Bundler:** Vite
